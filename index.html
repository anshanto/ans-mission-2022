            <p>I am <b>Shanto</b>. I already start my mission since 2019 middle of month. But i was in wrong path. Now i
                think
                i am in
                right path so that's why 31st December i start my new mission and my mission name is hard work. Remember
                job is
                not my mission and i don't want to qualify for only job. So i already break your rules and sorry for
                that. My
                mission is my goal and goal is my mission. i already complete my planing for the goal. Bcause with out a
                planing
                a goal is just a goal.</p>

            <h3>Develop Without Limits</h3>
            <p>Anything can't possible without time or success can't possible without hard work. So time and hard work
                bring success. I want to work really hard in this year. And i still do it. i am working 16 hours in one
                day. I wake up morning at 8 PM. After wake up i am go to table and work unstopble before until lunch.
                After finish lunch i take a break 2-3 hours and in that time i am go to bed for sleeping. Then i start
                my work again at 10:30 PM. I am working untill the Azan. It's time maybe 5:00 AM or 5:30 AM. Then i am
                go to bed for 3 hours and i take sleep. I set alarm at my phone for maintain time.So i think working has
                no limit.</p>

            <p>I am <b>Shanto</b>. I already start my mission since 2019 middle of month. But i was in wrong path. Now i
                think
                i am in
                right path so that's why 31st December i start my new mission and my mission name is hard work. Remember
                job is
                not my mission and i don't want to qualify for only job. So i already break your rules and sorry for
                that. My
                mission is my goal and goal is my mission. i already complete my planing for the goal. Bcause with out a
                planing
                a goal is just a goal.</p>

            <h3>Develop Without Limits</h3>
            <p>Anything can't possible without time or success can't possible without hard work. So time and hard work
                bring success. I want to work really hard in this year. And i still do it. i am working 16 hours in one
                day. I wake up morning at 8 PM. After wake up i am go to table and work unstopble before until lunch.
                After finish lunch i take a break 2-3 hours and in that time i am go to bed for sleeping. Then i start
                my work again at 10:30 PM. I am working untill the Azan. It's time maybe 5:00 AM or 5:30 AM. Then i am
                go to bed for 3 hours and i take sleep. I set alarm at my phone for maintain time.So i think working has
                no limit.</p>

            <h3>Know our Global Community</h3>
            <p>For the first time in history, it’s possible for everyone to know everything happening everywhere.<br>We
                are forging an awareness of our existence as a single entity. Nations are incorporating technology into
                the fabric of their economics, politics, culture and international relations. Because of our global
                information system, people of different psychological and cultural orientations — whether Silicon Valley
                computer genius or member of an Amazon tribe — are forced into a shared globalized
                context.</br><br>Globalization is the gradual process of the world shrinking as people of different
                nations, cultures and religions know more about one another. Western ideas and modes of living are
                seeping into the fabric of the world. The American baseball cap is now worn from Tahiti to Timbuktu.
                McDonald’s is ubiquitous.</br></p>

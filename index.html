            <p>I am <b>Shanto</b>. I already start my mission since 2019 middle of month. But i was in wrong path. Now i
                think
                i am in
                right path so that's why 31st December i start my new mission and my mission name is hard work. Remember
                job is
                not my mission and i don't want to qualify for only job. So i already break your rules and sorry for
                that. My
                mission is my goal and goal is my mission. i already complete my planing for the goal. Bcause with out a
                planing
                a goal is just a goal.</p>
